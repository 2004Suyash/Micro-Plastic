          <span class="p1">Micro means extremely small. And we all know what plastic means.
            So, when you break it down, microplastics can be defined as
            minuscule pieces of plastic debris. Most commonly known as a
            consequence of plastic pollution, microplastics are less than five
            millimetres in diameter. This is only four times as wide as a
            single grain of sand. Its also 0.003% the height of Danny DeVito.

            Labelling microplastics as tiny pieces of plastic is, of course,
            an all-too-simplified definition. A bit like calling Harry Styles
            “that bloke off X Factor”. Or Game of Thrones Joffrey “a bit of a
            nuisance”.

            And if you’re having flashbacks to your school days, you’re on the
            right track. Because primary microplastics arrive at the
            beginning. Secondary, on the other hand, is when things start to
            break down.
          </span>
          <span class="p1">
            Primary microplastics are microplastics that are purposefully
            created for commercial use. These manufactured microplastics
            include pellets and microbeads that can be found in clothing,
            cosmetics and care products.

            MCU (or what we like to call, the microplastic-contaminated
            universe). These are created as a result of plastic pollution when
            larger plastics break down over time.

        <div class="ans">
          <span class="p1">The microplastic cycle involves several stages:</span>
          <ol>
            <li><span>Emission:</span> Microplastics enter the environment through various pathways, including the
              fragmentation of larger plastic items, the shedding of microfibers from textiles during use and washing,
              the release of microbeads from personal care products, and the spillage of plastic pellets during
              manufacturing and transportation.</li>
            <br>
            <li><span>Transport:</span> Once released into the environment, microplastics can be transported through air
              currents, surface runoff, rivers, and ocean currents. This transport can lead microplastics to travel long
              distances from their original sources and become distributed throughout terrestrial and aquatic
              ecosystems.</li>
            <br>
            <li><span>Accumulation:</span> Microplastics accumulate in different environmental compartments, including
              soil, sediment, water bodies, and biota. In aquatic environments, microplastics may settle into sediments
              or float on the water surface, where they can be ingested by aquatic organisms or interact with biotic and
              abiotic components of the ecosystem.</li>
            <br>
            <li><span>Bioaccumulation:</span> Microplastics can be ingested by organisms at various trophic levels, from
              plankton to apex predators. Through bioaccumulation and biomagnification processes, microplastics and
              associated contaminants can become concentrated in the tissues of organisms, potentially leading to
              adverse effects on individual health and ecosystem functioning.</li>
            <br>
            <li><span>Degradation:</span> Microplastics can undergo physical, chemical, and biological degradation
              processes in the environment. While microplastics are resistant to degradation compared to natural
              materials, factors such as UV radiation, mechanical abrasion, and microbial activity can fragment
              microplastics into smaller particles over time.</li>
            <br>
            <li><span>Secondary Sources:</span> Once fragmented, microplastics can serve as secondary sources of
              pollution, releasing smaller particles and potentially harmful chemicals back into the environment. These
              secondary microplastics can contribute to ongoing pollution and perpetuate the microplastic cycle.</li>
          </ol>
          <span class="p1">Understanding the microplastic cycle is essential for developing effective strategies to
            mitigate microplastic pollution and protect environmental and human health. Efforts to address microplastic
            pollution require interdisciplinary approaches that consider the complex interactions between microplastics,
            organisms, and ecosystems throughout the cycle.</span>

            <strong>Aquatic Life:</strong> Microplastics can be ingested by a wide range of aquatic organisms, including
            fish, shellfish, seabirds, and marine mammals. These organisms may mistake microplastics for food, leading
            to ingestion and subsequent health issues. Ingested microplastics can cause physical harm, such as blockages
            or damage to the digestive tract, as well as leaching of toxic chemicals that can interfere with biological
            processes and disrupt hormonal balances. This can lead to reduced growth, reproductive issues, and even
            death in affected animals. Furthermore, microplastics can also serve as vectors for harmful microorganisms,
            potentially increasing the spread of diseases among aquatic organisms.

            <strong>Public Health:</strong> While the direct impact of microplastics on human health is still being
            researched, there is growing concern about the potential risks. Microplastics can enter the human body
            through various pathways, including ingestion of contaminated seafood, inhalation of airborne particles, and
            ingestion of food and water containing microplastics. Once inside the body, microplastics can accumulate and
            may cause inflammation, oxidative stress, and potentially disrupt cellular processes. Additionally,
            microplastics have the ability to absorb and concentrate toxic chemicals from the surrounding environment,
            and there is concern that these chemicals could be released within the body, posing additional health risks.
            Studies are ongoing to better understand the extent of human exposure to microplastics and their potential
            health effects.

            Overall, addressing the issue of microplastic pollution is important not only for the health of aquatic
            ecosystems but also for safeguarding public health. Efforts to reduce plastic waste, improve waste
            management practices, and develop alternative materials that are less harmful to the environment are
            essential steps in mitigating the impacts of microplastics on both aquatic life and human health.

            Monitoring microplastics in water bodies and their effects on aquatic life involves a multi-faceted approach
            that combines various sampling methods, analytical techniques, and ecological assessments.
          </span>
          <br />
          <br />
          <span>
            Here are some steps and techniques commonly used for monitoring microplastics in aquatic environments:
          </span>
          <ol>
            <li><strong>Sampling Design:</strong> Designing an effective sampling strategy is crucial for accurately
              assessing microplastic pollution in water bodies. This involves selecting sampling sites that represent
              different aquatic ecosystems (e.g., rivers, lakes, coastal areas), considering factors such as proximity
              to potential pollution sources and variability in environmental conditions. Sampling frequency and
              duration should also be determined to capture temporal variations in microplastic abundance.</li>
            <li><strong>Water Sampling:</strong> Collecting water samples is the primary method for assessing
              microplastic contamination in aquatic environments. Samples can be collected using various methods,
              including surface water grabs, sediment grabs, and water column sampling using nets or pumps. Sampling
              equipment should be carefully chosen to avoid contamination and ensure representative sampling.</li>
            <li><strong>Sediment Sampling:</strong> Sediment serves as a sink for microplastics, with high
              concentrations often found in the bottom layers of water bodies. Sediment sampling involves collecting
              samples from the bed of rivers, lakes, and oceans using corers or grab samplers. Sediment cores can be
              sectioned to analyze microplastic distribution with depth.</li>
            <li><strong>Biological Sampling:</strong> Assessing the ingestion of microplastics by aquatic organisms
              provides insights into their exposure and potential impacts. This can be done by collecting organisms such
              as fish, shellfish, and plankton and analyzing their gastrointestinal tracts for microplastic presence.
              Tissue samples can also be examined for microplastic accumulation.</li>
            <li><strong>Microplastic Extraction:</strong> Once collected, samples are processed to extract microplastics
              for analysis. This typically involves filtration, density separation, and digestion techniques to isolate
              microplastics from organic matter and sediment particles.</li>
            <li><strong>Microplastic Analysis:</strong> Microplastics extracted from water, sediment, and biological
              samples are then characterized and quantified using analytical techniques such as microscopy,
              spectroscopy, and chromatography. Microscopy techniques, including optical microscopy and scanning
              electron microscopy, are commonly used to identify and measure microplastic particles. Spectroscopic
              methods such as Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and Raman spectroscopy can provide
              information about the chemical composition of microplastics.</li>
            <li><strong>Ecological Assessments:</strong> In addition to assessing microplastic abundance, monitoring
              programs may also include ecological assessments to evaluate the effects of microplastics on aquatic life
              and ecosystem health. This can involve monitoring changes in biodiversity, population dynamics, and
              ecosystem functioning in microplastic-affected environments.</li>
          </ol>
          <span class="p1">
            By integrating these sampling methods, analytical techniques, and ecological assessments, researchers and
            environmental agencies can effectively monitor microplastic pollution in water bodies and its impacts on
            aquatic life. This information is crucial for developing strategies to mitigate microplastic pollution and
            protect aquatic ecosystems.

        <div class="ques1" id="seventh">How to Get Rid of Microplastics?</div>

        <div class="ans">

          <span class="p1">
            Getting rid of microplastics is incredibly difficult and expensive. It’s like finding a needle in a
            haystack, if the needle was the width of a strand of hair and the haystack was the ocean. And most
            techniques to “get rid of” microplastics only actually filter and separate them, rather than eliminating
            them entirely. This results in microplastic leftovers that continue to pollute food chains and ecosystems
            elsewhere.
          </span>
          <br />
          <br />
          <span>
            Scientists are working on methods to destroy microplastics, without creating or needing pollutant chemicals.
            Electrolytic oxidation, for example, uses electrodes to attack microplastics. However, despite being
            reusable, these electrodes don’t come cheap.
